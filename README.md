# Introduction
In the heart of community service, the absence of a centralized donation platform has presented a significant challenge for This Is Me, a spirited Community Based Organization committed to making a meaningful impact within our communities through a multitude of charitable activities.
Established in 2018, This Is Me has swiftly emerged as a force for good. However, the growing nature of the community has left certain aspects, particularly the donation management system, in a state of flux. The absence of a dedicated system has forced the community to resort to third-party options and, at times, manual collection processes.
This deficiency has far-reaching implications, most notably in the sector of accurate record-keeping and tracking for monetary collections. The lack of a streamlined donation management system has given rise to accountability issues, as the tracking of funds post-collection becomes a complicated task. This lack of infrastructure also means donors are deprived of a clear mechanism to trace detailed contact information, history with the organization, and interactions with the admin team. Moreover, the ability to monitor individual campaign metrics, donation sources, and gift sizes becomes a formidable challenge.
This issue, underscored by the community founder and the admin team, is not just an administrative hiccup; it slows down the community's ability to maximize its charitable activities due to inconsistencies in donation collection. The consequences extend beyond mere inconvenience; poor planning arises as third-party options may exhibit delays in releasing funds. Consequently, this jeopardizes the community's standing, leading to unsatisfactory experiences for its members and potential donors. A continuous cycle of inefficiency risks the community losing out on valuable opportunities and, in turn, slowing down its ability to carry out its commendable activities.
Regrettably, the plight, in terms of a donation management system, of small Community Based Organizations such as This Is Me is often overlooked in research and academic discourse. The scope of this issue is confined to these close-knit communities, and larger NGOs, while impactful, are too massive to entertain a centralized donation system. The lack of comprehensive research on this specific problem emphasizes the urgency and importance of addressing it.
In Kenya, M-Changa has emerged as an upstart, offering an online fundraising platform that has become the de facto solution for many organizations and fundraising committees. While M-Changa has been instrumental in facilitating online donations, it falls short in providing tailored solutions for specific organizations. It solely offers a platform for donations, leaving a void in the comprehensive management of donors and the tracking of community performance.
To help mitigate this situation, the proposed solution is an Online Donation Management System specifically tailored for This Is Me. This system will empower users to register, track their donations, and monitor the community's overall performance based on these contributions. By implementing such a solution, the community can efficiently manage each donor, ensure transparent and accurate allocation of funds within different dockets, and pave the way for a more organized and effective approach to community service.
The introduction of an Online Donation Management System is not just a technological upgrade; it is a strategic move to fortify This Is Me's commitment to community service. The proposed system will not only address the immediate challenges but also set the foundation for a more resilient and accountable community-based organization, self-assured to make an enduring impact.
